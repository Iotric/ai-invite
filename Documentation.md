## Why This Project?
### What is the purpose?
- Suppose a user wants to create personalised greeting videos for their relatives or knowns and
they don't want to create separate videos for each of them on their own so this is where we provide a solution,
So in our Project user uploads a Video and then do some changes with the transcription and then based on the changes
our platform provides multiple videos having same accent, voice, frames but different speech(or Spoken Transcription or Voice Over) 
and allows user to download each of the personalised video 

### Why its Better Than Market competitors?
- Our Platform Provides better Accuracy + Speed + Quality + Unique Technique which in turn makes our platform stand out of the crowd
- We Provide Best Available Models and Architecture under very less price and make it avaialable for everyone under free trail option

### What is the Simplicity Level of this Project?
- As Simple as Drinking Water lets see:
- **`User Upload Video`  ---> `User do changes in Transcription` ---> `User Download the Final Outputs in few seconds`**

## **🎬 1. Documentation Introduction** 📌📊  
- 📜 This document provides an in-depth explanation of the project's pipeline-based architecture.  
- 🔄 The division into multiple pipelines ensures modularity, scalability, and efficiency.  
- 🏗️ The data flow follows a structured process, ensuring high-quality outputs.  

### Project Workflow:
This is the internal Working of this Project(based on Pipelines and Ui Flow)
